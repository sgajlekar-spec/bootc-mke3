# Join machines with no-touch join

Add new worker machines to an existing `bootc-mke3` MKE 3 cluster using the
image's built-in first-boot join — no SSH to the new machine and no re-run of
the Ansible installer.

**This is the standard process for joining machines after the initial
install.** Production clusters typically disable SSH on cluster machines once
installed, which makes the Ansible installer unusable for later additions —
no-touch join is designed for exactly that situation.

The standard operating procedure is batch-oriented:

1. Issue a worker join token on a manager.
2. Join a **batch** of machines with that token.
3. **Rotate the token immediately after the batch has joined** — rotation
   invalidates the issued token, so a leaked credential is no longer a risk.
   Already-joined machines are unaffected.

For how the mechanism works internally, see the
[no-touch join description](../no-touch-join.md).

## Requirements

1. A running MKE 3 / Docker Swarm cluster with at least one reachable manager.
2. New machines provisioned from a `bootc-mke3` image (all current images ship
   `swarm-join.service` enabled).
3. Network path from each new machine to a manager per the [port
   requirements](#port-requirements) below — the join itself only needs the
   join-minimum row.
4. Access to a manager node to issue a join token.

### Port requirements

| Scenario | Ports |
|---|---|
| Join minimum | `2377/tcp`, `7946/tcp+udp`, `4789/udp` |
| Full post-join operation | `mke_worker_internal`: `179/tcp`, `4789/udp`, `7946/tcp+udp`, `9091/tcp`, `9100/tcp`, `10250/tcp`, `12376/tcp`; `mke_worker_self`: `6444/tcp`, `9099/tcp`, `10248/tcp`, `12378/tcp`, `12389/tcp` |

Both service definitions are visible via `firewall-cmd --get-services` on any
manager. Opening only the join-minimum set is enough for the join handshake
itself, but a later `ucp upgrade checks` run — or any full-cluster health
probe — will fail naming blocked ports once it reaches past the
join-minimum set. Provision the full set at the AWS security-group (or
equivalent network) layer from the start rather than widening it after the
fact.

## Procedure

### 1. Collect the join credential (on any manager)

```
docker swarm join-token -q worker                    # -> SWMTKN-1-...
docker info --format '{{.Swarm.NodeAddr}}'           # -> manager advertise IP
```

Use the **worker** token. The manager endpoint is `<NodeAddr>:2377`.

### 2. Inject the credential into each new machine

Pick the delivery path that matches how the machine is provisioned. The
credential payload is identical in all cases:

```
SWARM_TOKEN=SWMTKN-1-<your-worker-token>
SWARM_MANAGER=10.0.0.10:2377
```

**Kickstart is the primary path**: production `bootc-mke3` machines are
provisioned from the ISO (bare metal), where kickstart is the standard
customization mechanism. Cloud-init applies **only to the cloud-platform
builds** (AMI/QCOW2) — it does not exist on bare-metal ISO installs — and
those builds are primarily used for internal testing. systemd credentials
work on either, where the infrastructure can deliver them.

Two node-local gaps must be handled in the same provisioning payload,
whichever delivery path you use:

- **Firewall.** A fresh machine's own firewalld (active by default) ships
  only the `ssh`, `cockpit`, and `dhcpv6-client` services — none of the
  cluster ports. The swarm join itself still succeeds (it's outbound-only),
  but the node is then unreachable for inbound gossip/overlay traffic until
  the firewall is opened. This is unrelated to the cluster's
  `disable_firewalld` Ansible variable (default `false` — Ansible-managed
  nodes keep firewalld on and get per-service rules from
  `tasks/mke-open-ports-tasks.yml`): a no-touch-joined worker is never
  touched by the Ansible installer at all, so that variable's value
  elsewhere is irrelevant here — the node keeps the OS image's raw
  firewalld defaults until the provisioning payload configures it directly.
  Use the same zones/services `mke-open-ports-tasks.yml` applies to a
  worker (`public` zone for `mke_worker_internal`, `trusted` zone plus a
  trusted loopback interface for `mke_worker_self`), so the node ends up
  firewall-equivalent to one Ansible actually installed. The
  `firewall-cmd --permanent` + `--reload` pair takes effect immediately; no
  reboot is needed.
- **Kernel module preload.** Baked-in host hardening sets
  `kernel.modules_disabled=1`, which blocks loading the `xt_statistic`
  kernel module on any node whose kube-proxy starts *after* that lockdown
  sysctl has already applied — which is every node except whichever one
  happened to win the boot-time race during the initial cluster stand-up,
  so this recurs on every no-touch-joined worker. Symptom: calico-node's
  install-cni init container `CrashLoopBackOff`, with kube-proxy logging
  `iptables-restore: Couldn't load match 'statistic'`. Preload the module
  via `/etc/modules-load.d/xt_statistic.conf` (content: the single line
  `xt_statistic`) — `systemd-modules-load.service` is ordered
  `Before=systemd-sysctl.service`, so a module listed there loads before
  the lockdown sysctl applies, but only on the *next* boot. A
  no-touch-joined worker is already running with the module unavailable, so
  it needs a self-triggered reboot after joining — gated on the join
  sentinel (`/var/lib/mke3/joined`, see
  [no-touch join](../no-touch-join.md)) so it can't race the join itself,
  via a small oneshot unit that polls then reboots.

#### Bare metal (kickstart — the standard path; file shredded after join)

Append to the kickstart `%post`: the credential file, the firewalld
services (correct zones), the `xt_statistic` preload, and the
sentinel-gated reboot unit:

```
%post --erroronfail
install -d -m 0700 /etc/mke3
cat > /etc/mke3/swarm-join.env <<'EOF'
SWARM_TOKEN=SWMTKN-1-<your-worker-token>
SWARM_MANAGER=10.0.0.10:2377
EOF
chmod 600 /etc/mke3/swarm-join.env

firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-interface=lo --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=mke_worker_internal --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=mke_worker_self --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

echo xt_statistic > /etc/modules-load.d/xt_statistic.conf

cat > /etc/systemd/system/mke3-postjoin-reboot.service <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Reboot once to activate xt_statistic after no-touch join
After=swarm-join.service
ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/mke3/postjoin-reboot-done

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 60); do [ -f /var/lib/mke3/joined ] && break; sleep 5; done; [ -f /var/lib/mke3/joined ] && touch /var/lib/mke3/postjoin-reboot-done && systemctl reboot'
EOF
systemctl enable --now mke3-postjoin-reboot.service
%end
```

The credential file is written to disk but shredded automatically after a
confirmed join.

#### Cloud (cloud-init user-data — cloud builds only; tmpfs delivery)

Applies only to the cloud-platform builds (AMI/QCOW2), primarily used for
internal testing. The credential file itself is written to tmpfs and never
touches disk. Note that cloud-init independently caches the raw user-data
under `/var/lib/cloud`; that cache is scrubbed automatically after a
successful join.

The same firewalld and `xt_statistic` handling as the kickstart path above,
expressed as cloud-config — pass as instance user-data (e.g. `aws ec2
run-instances --user-data file://...`):

```yaml
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /run/mke3/swarm-join.env
    permissions: '0600'
    content: |
      SWARM_TOKEN=SWMTKN-1-<your-worker-token>
      SWARM_MANAGER=10.0.0.10:2377
  - path: /etc/systemd/system/mke3-postjoin-reboot.service
    permissions: '0644'
    content: |
      [Unit]
      Description=Reboot once to activate xt_statistic after no-touch join
      After=swarm-join.service
      ConditionPathExists=!/var/lib/mke3/postjoin-reboot-done

      [Service]
      Type=oneshot
      ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 60); do [ -f /var/lib/mke3/joined ] && break; sleep 5; done; [ -f /var/lib/mke3/joined ] && touch /var/lib/mke3/postjoin-reboot-done && systemctl reboot'
runcmd:
  - firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-interface=lo --permanent
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=mke_worker_internal --permanent
  - firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --add-service=mke_worker_self --permanent
  - firewall-cmd --reload
  - echo xt_statistic > /etc/modules-load.d/xt_statistic.conf
  - systemctl enable --now mke3-postjoin-reboot.service
```

On AWS, harden the instance metadata service so the token in user-data is not
reachable from containers — require IMDSv2 with a hop limit of 1:

```
--metadata-options HttpTokens=required,HttpPutResponseHopLimit=1
```

#### systemd credentials (most secure)

Deliver `swarm.token` and `swarm.manager` as systemd system credentials
(SMBIOS OEM strings, kernel cmdline, or an encrypted/TPM-bound credstore). The
unit already imports both; no node-side change is needed. This source takes
precedence over both file paths.

### 3. Boot the machines

Nothing else to do. On first boot, after Docker is healthy, each machine joins
the swarm as a worker and MKE onboards it automatically.

### 4. Rotate the join token (after the batch has joined)

Once every machine in the batch appears in `docker node ls`, rotate the worker
token on a manager:

```
docker swarm join-token --rotate worker
```

Rotation invalidates the token used for the batch: even if a copy leaked
(user-data snapshot, kickstart archive, shoulder-surfed console), it can no
longer be used to join the cluster. Machines that already joined are
unaffected. The next batch starts again at step 1 with the fresh token.

## Expected Results

On a manager, `kubectl get nodes` is the authoritative check — confirm the
new machine appears and is `Ready`:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

`docker node ls` and the MKE UI (Shared Resources → Nodes) also list the
node, but treat both as secondary/informational only. A confirmed anomaly
(sourced from `ucp-controller`) can leave a fully `Ready`, schedulable
worker showing `Down` in `docker node ls` indefinitely, with the message
"Node not yet found in classic node inventory" — this does not mean the
node is broken. Don't block a batch, or start troubleshooting, on
`docker node ls`/the MKE UI alone; cross-check `kubectl get nodes` first.

On the joined machine (if you have access):

```
systemctl status swarm-join.service               # active (exited); unit now disabled
cat /var/lib/mke3/joined                          # UTC join timestamp
docker info --format '{{.Swarm.LocalNodeState}}'  # active
```

No token residue remains: `/etc/mke3/swarm-join.env` is shredded (bare metal),
`/run/mke3` is RAM-only (cloud), and cloud-init's cached user-data copies are
scrubbed. The token value appears in no log.

## Troubleshooting

Inspect `journalctl -u swarm-join` on the machine first — failures log a
`swarm-join: ERROR` prefix (never the token value).

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `failed to join swarm after 5 attempts` | Manager unreachable: wrong `SWARM_MANAGER`, or TCP `2377` blocked | Check `nc -vz <manager> 2377` from the machine; fix address/firewall; re-trigger |
| Join rejected on every attempt | Token was rotated on the swarm, or a manager token was supplied | Issue a fresh `docker swarm join-token -q worker`; re-inject; re-trigger |
| `SWARM_TOKEN and SWARM_MANAGER must both be set` | Malformed or partial env file | Fix the injected file; both keys are required, `SWARM_MANAGER` needs `:2377` |
| `Docker not ready after 300s` | `docker.service` failed to start | Diagnose `systemctl status docker` on the machine; fix; re-trigger |
| Unit exits 0, no join, no sentinel | No credential was injected (typo'd path, user-data not applied) | Confirm the file exists at `/run/mke3/swarm-join.env` or `/etc/mke3/swarm-join.env`; inject and reboot |
| Unit no-ops on boot | Sentinel `/var/lib/mke3/joined` present from a prior join | Expected. To force a re-join, remove the sentinel and re-enable the unit |

### Re-triggering a join

The unit disables itself only on success, so after a failure it runs again on
the next boot. To re-run immediately after fixing the credential or network:

```
sudo rm -f /var/lib/mke3/joined          # only if a sentinel was written
sudo systemctl enable --now swarm-join.service
sudo systemctl status swarm-join.service
```

## F.A.Q

### Can this join managers?

No. The no-touch mechanism joins **workers only**. Managers are added via the
Ansible installer.

### Does this replace the Ansible worker join?

After the initial install — yes. The Ansible installer joins the workers it
provisions at install time, but SSH is typically disabled on cluster machines
afterwards, so the installer cannot add machines later. No-touch join is the
standard process for all post-install additions.

### Is the join secure against a rogue manager?

The `SWMTKN-1-<ca-hash>-<secret>` token embeds the cluster CA hash, so the
joining node validates the manager's TLS certificate as part of the join.
