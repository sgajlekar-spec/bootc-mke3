# Machine configuration changes (machine-config-controller)

Apply host-level configuration — DNS, NTP, kernel sysctls/modules, and
structured cluster-wide reboots — via the baked-in `machine-config-controller`,
using the `MachineConfigChange` custom resource. See the
[controllers runbook](install-controllers.md) for what deploys this
controller, the `mke`/`system-upgrade` namespace note, and how to verify its
version; this runbook only covers using it once it's confirmed healthy.

## Requirements

1. `machine-config-controller` deployed and verified per the
   [controllers runbook](install-controllers.md).
2. Cluster access per the [access runbook](access-cluster.md) — no SSH is
   needed for anything below.
3. The CRD's actual schema, read from the cluster you're operating on, not
   from this doc or an old sample:

   ```sh
   kubectl get crd -o name | grep machineconfigchanges
   kubectl get crd <the name above> -o yaml
   ```

   The chart baked into a given image build (and therefore its CRD's exact
   `apiVersion` and `status` field names) can differ across builds — always
   confirm against the live CRD before writing a `MachineConfigChange`.
   Baked sample manifests for reference are also on any cluster node under
   `/usr/share/mke-controllers/manifests/machine-config-controller-samples/`.

## Procedure

### Non-reboot changes: network, ntp, kernel

These `spec` areas can be combined freely in a single `MachineConfigChange`
and are safely re-appliable — changing the values and re-applying
reconfigures the node, this is not a one-shot apply:

```yaml
apiVersion: <from the installed CRD, see Requirements>
kind: MachineConfigChange
metadata:
  name: mcc-example
spec:
  network:
    nameservers: ["1.1.1.1", "9.9.9.9"]
    searchDomains: ["example.com"]
  ntp:
    servers: ["<primary-ntp-host-or-ip>"]
    fallbackServers: ["<fallback-ntp-host-or-ip>"]
  kernel:
    sysctl:
      vm.swappiness: "10"
  rollout:
    concurrency: <N>
    drain: true
```

Apply it, then watch the resource's `Applied` condition reach `True`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f mcc-example.yaml
kubectl get machineconfigchange mcc-example -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
```

### Reboot: always a dedicated resource

The same CRD's `reboot` module drives a structured, cluster-wide rolling
reboot — but with two hard rules that are load-bearing enough to repeat
here. For the full operational picture (quorum-safe splitting across roles,
stuck-node diagnosis and recovery, and reconvergence behavior for nodes that
join later), see the machine-config-controller project's own
[structured reboot runbook](https://github.com/Mirantis/machine-config-controller/blob/main/docs/structured-reboot.md)
— it is not duplicated here:

- `reboot` must be the **only** module in its `MachineConfigChange`. Never
  combine it with `network`/`ntp`/`kernel` in the same resource — modules
  apply sequentially and the reboot kills the node mid-run, so anything
  ordered after it may never execute on that pass.
- `rollout.concurrency` must stay `1`. Any higher value reboots that many
  nodes at once, which can break control-plane quorum or workload
  availability.

```yaml
apiVersion: <from the installed CRD, see Requirements>
kind: MachineConfigChange
metadata:
  name: mcc-reboot
spec:
  reboot:
    token: "<opaque token, e.g. a date or change-ticket id>"
  rollout:
    concurrency: 1
    drain: true
```

Delete the resource once the rollout completes. It's a trigger, not a
desired state — leaving it applied re-arms a reboot for any node that joins
the cluster afterwards (see the upstream runbook's reconvergence section).

## Expected Results

- `kubectl get machineconfigchange <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'`
  shows the `Applied` condition `True`.
- The change is visible on affected nodes — e.g. `sysctl <key>`,
  `chronyc -N sources`, `/etc/resolv.conf`, or, for a reboot, a fresh
  `uptime` on each node in turn.
- All targeted nodes stay `Ready` in `kubectl get nodes` throughout and after
  the rollout.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `kubectl apply` fails `strict decoding error: unknown field "spec.reboot"` (or any other module) | The controller's CRD is stale relative to its chart | See the [controllers runbook](install-controllers.md#machine-config-controllers-chart-is-the-exception--it-registry-pulls-by-default) for `kubectl apply -f <chart>/crds/*.yaml` |
| `Applied=False/Applying` stuck for a long time | A targeted node isn't converging (reboot never returned, drain stuck) | See the upstream [structured reboot runbook](https://github.com/Mirantis/machine-config-controller/blob/main/docs/structured-reboot.md#stuck-node-diagnosis-and-recovery) — the same Plan/job inspection it describes applies to non-reboot modules too |
| A `mcc-reboot` resource is still applied well after its rollout finished | Not deleted post-rollout | Delete it — a lingering reboot resource re-triggers once on any node that later joins the cluster |
