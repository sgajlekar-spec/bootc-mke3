# No-touch cluster join

`bootc-mke3` images ship a first-boot mechanism that lets a freshly provisioned
machine join an existing Docker Swarm / MKE 3 cluster **as a worker** with no
SSH access and no manual `docker swarm join` — "no-touch". The only per-node
input is a worker join token and a manager endpoint, injected by whatever
provisions the machine (cloud-init user-data, kickstart, or systemd
credentials).

No-touch join is the **standard process for adding machines to a cluster after
the initial install**: production clusters typically disable SSH on cluster
machines once installed, so the Ansible installer cannot join machines later.

This page describes how the mechanism works. For step-by-step instructions on
joining machines, see the [no-touch join runbook](runbooks/join-machines-no-touch.md).

## Components baked into the image

| Component | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| systemd unit | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/swarm-join.service` | Oneshot, enabled by default, ordered after `docker.service` |
| Resolver script | `/usr/libexec/swarm-join` | Finds the credential, performs the join, cleans up |
| Sentinel | `/var/lib/mke3/joined` | Written after a successful join; makes the mechanism idempotent |

## First-boot flow

On boot, `swarm-join.service` starts once Docker is up and runs the resolver,
which:

1. **Exits immediately** if the sentinel `/var/lib/mke3/joined` exists
   (already joined; safe across reboots).
2. **Resolves the credential** from the first available source, in priority
   order:
   1. **systemd credentials** — `swarm.token` + `swarm.manager` imported via
      `ImportCredential=` (SMBIOS, kernel cmdline, or encrypted/TPM-bound
      credstore). Most secure option.
   2. **tmpfs file** — `/run/mke3/swarm-join.env`. Intended for cloud-init:
      the file lives in RAM and never persists across reboot.
   3. **persistent file** — `/etc/mke3/swarm-join.env`. Intended for
      kickstart-provisioned bare metal; shredded after a confirmed join.
3. **Waits for Docker** to become healthy (up to 300 s by default).
4. **Joins the swarm**: `docker swarm join --token <token> <manager>:2377`,
   retrying up to 5 times at 10 s intervals.
5. **Cleans up** on success: shreds the persistent `/etc` file (if that was the
   source), scrubs any copy of the credential that cloud-init cached under
   `/var/lib/cloud` (cloud-init persists raw user-data regardless of which
   delivery path was used), writes the sentinel, and disables
   `swarm-join.service`.

If **no credential is found**, the unit exits 0 as a no-op and stays enabled —
injecting a token later plus a reboot still joins the machine. If the join
**fails**, the unit fails visibly (`systemctl status swarm-join`), stays
enabled, and retries on the next boot.

Once the machine is in the swarm, MKE onboards it automatically — the new
worker appears in the MKE UI and `docker node ls` without further action.

## Credential format

Both file sources use the same shell env-file format:

```
SWARM_TOKEN=SWMTKN-1-...
SWARM_MANAGER=<manager-host-or-ip>:2377
```

`SWARM_MANAGER` must be the full `host:port` join address (port `2377`).
The token must be a **worker** token (`docker swarm join-token -q worker` on a
manager). The full `SWMTKN-1-<ca-hash>-<secret>` token embeds the manager CA
hash, so the join validates the manager's TLS certificate — no extra pinning is
needed.

## Security properties

- The token value is **never logged**; `journalctl -u swarm-join` shows only
  the manager endpoint and the source label.
- The tmpfs path never touches disk. The persistent path is shredded after a
  confirmed join. Cloud-init's own user-data cache copies are scrubbed too.
- The systemd-credential path supports encrypted and TPM-bound delivery.
- The mechanism joins **workers only** — there is no manager-promotion path.
- **Token lifecycle (SOP):** issue a worker token per **batch** of machines,
  and rotate it on a manager (`docker swarm join-token --rotate worker`) as
  soon as the batch has joined. Rotation invalidates the issued token, so a
  leaked copy is no longer a risk; already-joined machines are unaffected.

## Tunables

Environment overrides honored by the resolver (set via a systemd drop-in):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SWARM_READY_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds to wait for Docker to become healthy |
| `SWARM_JOIN_RETRIES` | `5` | Join attempts before the unit fails |
| `SWARM_JOIN_INTERVAL` | `10` | Seconds between join attempts |
