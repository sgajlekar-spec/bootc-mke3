## Installation Guide

Installation covers everything from provisioning bare infrastructure to a running MKE cluster: registry and machine requirements, provisioning with Terraform (vSphere/AWS) or manually, running the Ansible installer, and the controllers deployed by default post-install. See the full guide at [Installation guide documentation pages](docs/installation-guide.md).

### Assets

Mirantis provides assets for provisioning `bootc-mke3` on different providers. Assets consist of bootable images that can be used to provision a virtual machine or bare-metal machine.

## Operations Guide

Operations covers day-2 tasks on a running cluster: upgrading it (via the `ClusterUpgrade` CR or the Ansible exception path), adding machines with no-touch join, accessing it with the MKE client bundle, and securing it. See the full guide at [Operations guide documentation pages](docs/operations-guide.md).
