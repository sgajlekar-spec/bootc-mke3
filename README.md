# bootc-mke3

`bootc-mke3` is an integrated container orchestration platform that is powered by an immutable Rocky Linux operating system, offering next-level security and reliability.

This repository contains a collection of tool, utilities and guides for managing and operating with `bootc-mke3`. These tools support operations, automation, and configuration for secure and scalable container environments.

## Provisioning

Provisioning is the process of preparing a cluster of `bootc-mke3` compute nodes within a network environment that meets the requirements for deploying and operating Mirantis products.

For further details, please see [provisioning document](docs/provisioning.md).

### Assets

Mirantis provides assets for provisioning `bootc-mke3` on different providers. Assets consist of bootable images that can be used to provision virtual machine or baremetale machine.

## Installation

Installation in this document refers to the process of deploying Mirantis Kubernetes Engine on top of already provisioned machines (VMs or baremetal). 

To perform installation, [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) is used. There are number of tasks and the playbook that serves this purpose.

Prerequisites for the installation can be found in the [Provisioning](#provisioning) section of this document.

To perform the installation, please see [installation runbook](docs/runbooks/install-bootc-mke3.md).

## Upgrade

To perform an upgrade , please see [upgrade runbook](docs/runbooks/upgrade-bootc-mke3.md).

## Adding machines (no-touch join)

New worker machines can join an existing cluster automatically on first boot — no SSH and no installer re-run. The image ships the mechanism; provisioning only injects a join token. See the [no-touch join description](docs/no-touch-join.md) and the [join machines runbook](docs/runbooks/join-machines-no-touch.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, file an issue, or talk to us on the #prod-eng or #mkex-internal channel on the Mirantis Slack server.
